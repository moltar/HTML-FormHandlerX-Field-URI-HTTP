=head1 NAME

HTML::FormHandlerX::Field::URI::HTTP - an HTTP URI field

=head1 VERSION

0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This field inherits from a Text field and is used to validate HTTP(S) URIs.
Validate values are inflated into an L<URI> object.

=head1 METHODS

Only one extra method is supported:

=head2 scheme

This method is used to set the type of regex used for validating the URI. By
default both HTTP and HTTPS URIs are marked as valid. You can set this to only
validate HTTP or HTTPS if you wish:

  scheme => qr/http/i,   # only validate HTTP URIs
  scheme => qr/https/i,  # only validate HTTPS URIs
  scheme => qr/https?/i, # validate both HTTP and HTTPS (default behaviour)
